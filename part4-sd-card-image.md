# Part 4: SD Card Image

In the previous parts of our workshop to build a 64bit Docker OS for the Raspberry Pi 3 we're going through all the steps to create the basic building blocks and components we need:

1. [Bootloader](/part1-bootloader.md) - specific for the Raspberry Pi
2. [Kernel](/part2-kernel.md) - a Linux kernel in 64bit with the current LTS version 4.9.13 compiled and configured for the Raspberry Pi 3
3. [Root Filesystem](/part3-root-filesystem.md) - from HypriotOS based on Debian/Jessie for AARCH64
